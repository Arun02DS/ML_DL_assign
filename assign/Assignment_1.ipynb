    "In programming, a \"string\" and a \"variable\" are two different concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. String:\n",
    "   A string is a data type used to represent a sequence of characters. It can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and even spaces. In most programming languages, strings are enclosed in either single quotes (' ') or double quotes (\" \"). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_string = \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the example above, `\"Hello, world!\"` is a string, and it is assigned to the variable `my_string`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variable:\n",
    "   A variable is a named storage location in a program's memory that holds a value. It acts as a reference to a memory location where data is stored. Variables can hold different types of data, such as strings, numbers, or other complex data structures. They allow programmers to store and manipulate data during program execution. Variables are assigned values using the assignment operator (=). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   age = 30\n",
    "   name = \"John\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this case, `age` and `name` are variables that hold the values `30` and `\"John\"`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a string is a specific data type used to represent textual data, while a variable is a named container that can hold different types of data, including strings. Variables are used to store and manipulate data, including strings, during the execution of a program.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Float (Floating-Point):\n",
    "   The float data type represents numbers with decimal points. It is used to store real numbers and provides a way to represent both integer and fractional values. Floats have a higher precision than integers, but they might have some rounding errors due to limited precision in representing real numbers. Examples of floats are 3.14, -2.75, 0.5, and 100.0.\n",

    "An expression is a combination of one or more constants, variables, operators, and function calls, which, when evaluated, results in a single value. Expressions can be as simple as a single constant or variable, or they can be more complex, involving multiple components connected by operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components of an Expression:\n",
    "1. Constants: Literal values that do not change during the program's execution, such as numbers or strings. For example: `42`, `\"Hello\"`, `3.14`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variables: Symbols that represent memory locations holding data. The value of variables can change during the program's execution. For example: `x`, `count`, `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Operators: Symbols that perform operations on operands (constants, variables, or other expressions). Common operators include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=), logical operators (and, or, not), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Function Calls: Invocations of functions that take arguments and return values. Function calls can also be considered expressions if the function returns a value. For example: `len(\"hello\")`, `math.sqrt(16)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Expressions Do:\n",

    "The main difference between an expression and a statement lies in their purpose and behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Expression:\n",
    "   An expression is a combination of constants, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a value. Expressions always result in a value, and their evaluation does not alter the state of the program or any variables. They are used to compute and represent values. Examples of expressions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 5             # The expression is '5' (a constant), and it is assigned to 'x'.\n",
    "   y = x + 3         # The expression is 'x + 3', which evaluates to a value and is then assigned to 'y'.\n",
    "   result = (2 * y)  # The expression is '(2 * y)', which involves variables and arithmetic operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(2 + 3)      # The expression '2 + 3' is evaluated, but the result is not stored anywhere.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Statement:\n",
    "   A statement is a complete unit of code that performs some action. Unlike expressions, statements do not produce values. Instead, they are instructions that affect the program's state by assigning values, controlling the flow of execution, or defining structures. Examples of statements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 10            # This is an assignment statement that sets the value of 'x' to 10.\n",
    "   if x > 5:         # This is an if statement that controls the flow of execution based on the condition 'x > 5'.\n",
    "       print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   for i in range(5):  # This is a for loop statement that iterates five times.\n",
    "       print(i)\n",

    "   def function_name():  # This is a function definition statement.\n",
    "       return \"Hello\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "expressions are used to compute and represent values, while statements are used to perform actions, control flow, and define structures in a program. An assignment statement like `spam = 10` is an example of a statement, where the variable `spam` is assigned the value `10`. The right-hand side of the assignment statement, `10`, is an example of an expression, as it can be evaluated to produce the value `10`.\n",

    "In most programming languages, including Python, variable names must follow certain rules and conventions. These rules are in place to ensure that variable names are unambiguous, easy to understand, and don't conflict with language syntax or reserved keywords. Here are the general rules for valid variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with a letter or underscore (_):** Variable names must begin with a letter (a-z or A-Z) or an underscore (_). They cannot start with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Followed by letters, digits, or underscores:** After the first character, the variable name can consist of letters, digits, or underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No special characters or spaces:** Variable names cannot contain special characters such as !, @, #, $, %, etc., or spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at the examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **eggs**: This is a valid variable name because it starts with a letter 'e' and is followed by two more letters 'g' and 's'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **100**: This is an invalid variable name because it starts with a digit '1'. According to the rules, variable names must start with a letter or an underscore, not a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "While `100` is invalid as a variable name, you can use it as a value or assign it to a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 100  # This is valid. 'x' is the variable name, and '100' is the value assigned to it.\n",
    "```\n",

    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
