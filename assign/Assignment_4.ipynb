    "Tuples and lists are both data structures in Python used to store collections of items, but they have several key differences:\n",

    "   - Lists are defined using square brackets `[ ]`.\n",
    "   - Tuples are defined using parentheses `( )`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance:**\n",
    "   - Lists have slightly more overhead compared to tuples because lists are mutable. The extra overhead is due to the need to manage the ability to change the elements in a list.\n",
    "   - Tuples have less overhead and are generally faster when accessing elements because they are immutable.\n",

    "4. **Use Case:**\n",
    "   - Use lists when you need a collection of elements that may change over time, or when you require flexibility to add, remove, or modify elements.\n",
    "   - Use tuples when you have a fixed set of elements that you do not want to change. Tuples are often used for collections of related values or to return multiple values from a function.\n",

    "5. **Typical Scenarios:**\n",
    "   - Lists are commonly used for dynamic data like user input, data that needs to be modified, or when the number of elements may change during program execution.\n",
    "   - Tuples are often used to represent fixed collections of related data, such as coordinates (x, y), RGB color values, or dates.\n",

    "Variables that \"contain\" list values in Python are not the lists themselves, but rather references or pointers to the list objects in memory. When you assign a list to a variable, the variable does not store the actual list data. Instead, it stores the memory address (reference) where the list is located in the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, all variables that hold mutable objects, such as lists, dictionaries, or sets, are references to the memory location of the actual object. On the other hand, variables holding immutable objects, like integers, strings, or tuples, store the actual values directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate this with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assigning a list to a variable\n",
    "original_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "# 'original_list' contains a reference to the list object in memory\n",

    "\n",
    "This behavior is important to understand when working with mutable objects like lists because modifying the object through one variable will affect all other variables that reference the same object. If you want to create a copy of a list to have a separate and independent object, you need to use the `copy()` method or slicing to create a shallow copy. For example:\n",

    "new_list = original_list[:]       # Creates a shallow copy of the list\n",

    "In Python, the `copy` module provides two methods for creating copies of objects: `copy()` and `deepcopy()`. Both methods are used to duplicate objects, but they differ in how they handle objects containing other objects (nested objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`copy.copy()` (Shallow Copy):**\n",
    "   - The `copy.copy()` method creates a shallow copy of an object. It copies the object itself, but not the objects that the original object contains.\n",
    "   - If the object being copied contains other mutable objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries, or other custom objects), the copied object will still reference the same nested objects as the original object.\n",
    "   - Changes made to the nested objects in the copied object will affect the corresponding nested objects in the original object.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "   original_list = [1, [2, 3], 4]\n",
    "   copied_list = copy.copy(original_list)\n",

    "   print(original_list)    # Output: [1, [100, 3], 4]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`copy.deepcopy()` (Deep Copy):**\n",
    "   - The `copy.deepcopy()` method creates a deep copy of an object. It copies both the object itself and all the objects that the original object contains, recursively.\n",
    "   - If the object being copied contains other mutable objects, the copied object will have its own separate copies of those nested objects. Changes made to the nested objects in the copied object will not affect the corresponding nested objects in the original object.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "   original_list = [1, [2, 3], 4]\n",
    "   deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Modify the nested list in the deep copied object\n",
    "   deep_copied_list[1][0] = 100\n",
    "   print(deep_copied_list)    # Output: [1, [100, 3], 4]\n",
    "   print(original_list)       # Output: [1, [2, 3], 4]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `copy.copy()` creates a shallow copy of an object, while `copy.deepcopy()` creates a deep copy of an object, including all nested objects. If you need to duplicate an object and want to ensure that changes made to nested objects in the copy do not affect the original object, you should use `copy.deepcopy()`. However, if you only need a top-level copy and don't mind sharing nested objects with the original, `copy.copy()` may be sufficient.\n",
