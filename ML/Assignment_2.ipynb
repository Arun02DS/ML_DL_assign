    "- Reinforcement learning is inspired by the reward system of operant conditioning (Sutton & Barto, 1998). Operant conditioning was established by B. F. Skinner (1938), after Edward Thorndike (1927) observed how cats learn to escape a puzzle box more quickly after a repeated number of trials. Thorndike noted that behaviours that helped the cats to escape were repeated more frequently over time compared to behaviours that did not, and he termed this the law of effect."
